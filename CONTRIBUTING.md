## Code reviews

GitHub pull requests can be reviewed by all such that input can be given to the author(s).

for more information.

## Coding Guidelines

* Discuss the feature
* Do development
  + Follow the code style
* Commits should be atomic and semantic. Therefore, squash your pull request before submission and keep it rebased until merged
  + If your feature has independent parts submit those as separate pull requests

## Discuss a Feature

You can discuss bug reports, enhancements and features in our [forum](https://github.com/ArgusCapture/ArgusCapture/discussions).

Once there is an agreement on the development plan you can open an issue that will used for reference in the pull request.

## Development

You can follow this workflow for your development.

Add your repository

```
git clone git@github.com:yourname/ArgusCapture.git
cd ArgusCapture
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArgusCapture/ArgusCapture.git
```

Create a work branch

```
git checkout -b mywork main
```

During development

```
git commit -a -m "[#issue] My feature"
git push -f origin mywork
```

If you have more commits then squash them

```
git rebase -i HEAD~2
git push -f origin mywork
```

If the `main` branch changes then

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase -i upstream/main
git push -f origin mywork
```

as all pull requests should be squashed and rebased.

In your first pull request you need to add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file.

## Code Style

Please, follow the coding style of the project.

You can use the [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) tool to help with the formatting, by running

```
cargo fmt
```

and verify the changes.
